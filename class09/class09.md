## Background

Today we are taking a small detour to anlazye a dataset (that we have
more intrinsic insight into) with the most useful analysis method we
have learned thus far - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Data Import: Importing Candy Data

``` r
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names=1) #reads csv and organizes it 
head(candy) #displays first few elements

> From your use of the skim() function use the output to answer the
> following:

### Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The histogram “hist” column looks to be on a different scale to the
majority of the other columns in the dataset.

### Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the `candy$chocolate` column?

For the candy\$chocolate column, the zero and the one is most likely a
binary operator where “0” means the candy does not have chocolate and
“1” means the candy has chocolate.

# 3. Exploratory Analysis

### Q8. Plot a histogram of `winpercent` values using both base R and ggplot2.

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

    Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2

``` r
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent)+
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

### Q9. Is the distribution of `winpercent` values symmetrical?

No, they skew right a little bit.

### Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

``` r
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
      22.45   39.14   47.83   50.32   59.86   84.18 

The center of the distribution is mostly below 50% as the median is
47.83.

### Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

Yes, chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruit candy as the mean of
chocolate candy winpercent is 60.92153, while the mean of fruity candy
winpercent is 44.11974.

``` r
#chocolate candy
choc.ind <- as.logical(candy$chocolate) #true and falses for choc candy 
choc.candy <- candy[choc.ind, ] #access just choc candy 
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent # access just winpercent values
mean(choc.win) #print out mean function of the winpercent
```

    [1] 60.92153

``` r
#fruity candy 
fruity.ind <- as.logical(candy$fruity) #true and falses for fruity candy 
fruity.candy <- candy[fruity.ind, ] #access just fruity candy 
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent # access just winpercent values
mean(fruity.win) #print out mean function of the winpercent  
```

    [1] 44.11974

### Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  choc.win and fruity.win
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     11.44563 22.15795
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     60.92153  44.11974 

This difference is statistically significant, as the p-value, 2.871e-08,
is much less than 0.05 and thus statistically significant.

The top 5 all time favorite candy types are Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup,
Reese’s Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers.

### Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

``` r
library(ggplot2) #CONSOLE: install.packages("ggplot2")

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

### Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

``` r
library(ggplot2) 

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +

## 4.0.1 Time to add some useful color

``` r
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))

#chocolate candy in chocolate color 
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"

#candy bars in brown 
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"

#fruity candy in pink 
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) + #fills columns as different candy type colors
  ylab("")
```

### Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst ranked chocolate candy is Sixlets.

### Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked fruity candy is Starburst.

# 5. Taking a look at pricepercent

We can fix the label text overplotitng with an add on package called
**ggrepel** and its `geom_text_repel()`.

> Make a plot of winpercent vs. pricepercent

``` r
library(ggrepel)# CONSOLE: install.packages("ggrepel")
```

    Warning: package 'ggrepel' was built under R version 4.5.2

``` r
# How about a plot of win vs price
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

### Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

The candy type the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least
money is the Reese’s Miniatures because it is in the lowest right corner
of the plot. It has a high winpercent and low pricepercent.

### Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

``` r
# order price percent from high to low
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)  
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 ) 
```

                             pricepercent winpercent
    Nik L Nip                       0.976   22.44534
    Nestle Smarties                 0.976   37.88719
    Ring pop                        0.965   35.29076
    Hershey's Krackel               0.918   62.28448
    Hershey's Milk Chocolate        0.918   56.49050

The top 5 most expensive candy types are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties,
Ring pop, Hershey’s Krackel, Hershey’s Milk Chocolate. The least popular
is Nik L Nip (22.44534% winpercent).

# 6. Exploring the correlation structure

We can calculate the pair-wise correlation of all our columns

``` r
library(corrplot) # CONSOLE: install.packages("corrplot")
```

    corrplot 0.95 loaded

``` r
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij) 
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

### Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

The two variables “Chocolate” and “Candy” are anti-correlated because
they have red values for each other.

### Q23. Use your corrplot result to make a prediction: which variables do you expect will have the largest contributions (i.e. loadings) to PC1 (i.e., drive the most separation between candies along the first principal component)?

The variables “chocolate”, “fruity”, and “bar” will have the largest
contributions to PC1 because they have the largest contributions.

# 7. Principal Component Analysis

In this case we want to be sure to set `scale=TRUE` argument for
`prcomp()` because we have one varaible, `winpercent`, that is on a very
different scale than all others and would otherwise dominate our PCA
results.

``` r
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                              PC1    PC2    PC3     PC4    PC5     PC6     PC7

**First major result figure is the “score plot” of PC1 vs PC2 - how the
different candy are related to each other on our new PC axis:**

``` r
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                              PC1    PC2    PC3     PC4    PC5     PC6     PC7

Now we can plot our main PCA score plot of PC1 vs PC2.

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

> We can change the plotting character and add some color:

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

> We can make a much nicer plot with the ggplot2 package but it is
> important to note that ggplot works best when you supply an input

``` r
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

``` r
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)

``` r
library(ggrepel)
p +
  geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +

### Q24. Complete the code to generate the loadings plot above. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you? Where did you see this relationship highlighted previously?

The variables picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction are
“hard”, “pluribus”, and “fruity”. This makes sense because in the
correlation plot earlier, those three variables showed anti-correlation,
with negative values and red dots, opposing the chocolate candies.

# 8. Summary

### Q25. Based on your exploratory analysis, correlation findings, and PCA results, what combination of characteristics appears to make a “winning” candy? How do these different analyses (visualization, correlation, PCA) support or complement each other in reaching this conclusion?

A combination of chocolate, bar , and not fruity characteristics appear
to make a “winning” candy. The visualizations display the ranking
patterns by winpercent and groups by different types of candy, the
correlation matrix shows the relationships between these variables
(candy elements), and the PCA separates chocolate/bar candies from
fruity/pluribus/hard candies in a new axis of variation, which supports
the correlation matrix structure.
